This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Hack related to implicit type conversion of nullable types in function arguments. The `foo` function expects an integer, but the caller passes a nullable integer which leads to a runtime error if the value is actually null.  The solution shows how to explicitly handle the nullable type to prevent this error. This is a subtle bug that might not be immediately apparent to developers working with nullable types in Hack.
